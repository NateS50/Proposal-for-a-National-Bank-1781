When creating my metadata table, I chose to include the following fields: file name, identifier, side, document title, document author, publication date, file type, file size, keywords, and notes. These ten metadata categories can be grouped into three main groups: Physical, Digital, and Informative. I identified these groups as what I believed to be most important and then chose specific metadata that work together to complete each category.  For Physical, I chose identifier, side, and notes. Then, for digital, I included file type, file name, and file size. Finally, the informative, document title, author, publication date, and keywords, together the metadata categories come together in groups to tell the story of a digitized piece of history.


Overall, my OCR experience went smoothly. To complete my document's OCR, I used ChatGPT-5 with little issues. The only problem I ran into was that it took a couple of tries for the AI to complete the task the way I wanted it to be done. The first attempt resulted in just paraphrasing and summarizing the document. In contrast, the second attempt omitted much of the text but was highly accurate in converting the image to text. Finally, on the third attempt, I was able to get ChatGPT-5 to fully extract the text into a .txt file. ChatGPT did an outstanding job, with only a handful of minor errors, after I clarified my directions and intentions with a few prompts. For reference, my document contained only two pages and no tables or images.
