When creating my metadata table, I chose to include the following fields: file name, identifier, side, document title, document author, publication date, file type, file size, keywords, and notes. These ten metadata categories can be grouped into three main groups: Physical, Digital, and Informative. I identified these groups as what I believed to be most important and then chose specific metadata that work together to complete each category.  For Physical, I chose identifier, side, and notes. Then, for digital, I included file type, file name, and file size. Finally, the informative, document title, author, publication date, and keywords, together the metadata categories come together in groups to tell the story of a digitized piece of history.
